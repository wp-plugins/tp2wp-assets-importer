TypePad to Wordpress helps you finish the migration of your blog / website from TypePad to Wordpress, by importing all the images included in your posts and pages.

== Description ==

TypePad to Wordpress parses all your content searching for images, copies these images to your new Wordpress install and updates your content to reference the new URLs of your images in your posts or pages.

== Installation ==

Upload the TypePad to Wordpress plugin to your blog, Activate it.
Then go to Settings > TypePad to Wordpress, fill in the field with your original TypePad URL. If you had a domain name mapped to your TypePad blog, you'll have to fill in this field too.
Then click on the big blue button and just wait for TypePad to Wordpress to import your content...

1, 2, 3: You're done!
